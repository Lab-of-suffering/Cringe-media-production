## 📖 Project Description
We’re building a tool that generates videos in the style of those legendary “grandma WhatsApp greetings.”  
Think holiday congratulations, cheerful photo collages, funny captions — all automatically created for you.  

The project will be implemented as a **Telegram bot** for maximum accessibility.  

- 🎯 **Goal**: Generate stylized video sequences with minimal user effort  
- 👵🧑‍💻 **Target audience**: grandmothers and zoomers  
- ⏱ **Why it matters**: saves time, sparks creativity, and makes sharing greetings easier & funnier

## How to run the project
1) Clone the repo
2) Make .env file with API keys from replicate.com and shotstack.io similar to .env.example
3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal
4) pipeline_example.ipynb can be launched after that, currently it will produce a video collage of 4 images
